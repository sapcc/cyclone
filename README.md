# cyclone

Clone OpenStack entities easily.

## Why?

In modern clusters compute instances are considered as a Cattle, but there are exceptions, when a compute instance is a Pet and needs care, especially when you need to migrate or clone it to a new OpenStack region or availability zone.

Here comes cyclone (**C**loud **Clone** or cclone) to help you with this task. It takes care about all volumes attached to a VM and clones them with all required intermediate type conversions.

## Help

By default the tool uses a Glance V2 [web-download](https://docs.openstack.org/glance/latest/admin/interoperable-image-import.html#image-import-methods) method to clone images. This method allows Glance to download an image using a remote URL. Set the `--image-web-download` option to **false** to use the default download/upload method. In this case the whole image data will be streamed through cyclone.

A remote URL can be generated using a Swift [Temporary URL](https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/api/temporary_url_middleware.html).

A volume migration is performed by converting a volume to an image and further image migration between regions, then converting an image back to a volume.

A volume migration within the same region is performed using a [Volume Transfer](https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/cli/cli-manage-volumes.html#transfer-a-volume) method.

By default the tool uses the same credentials from environment variables for the source and destination projects, but for the destination you can define different region, domain and project name. It is also possible to override destination credentials via OpenStack environment variables with the `TO_` prefix or via CLI parameters.

~> **Note:** Be aware about the quota, especially the source project quota, when cloning a volume. It requires up to 2x source volume size Cinder (Block Storage) quota. If a `--clone-via-snapshot` flag is specified, the quota requirement increases up to 3x source volume size.

~> **Note:** Cloning a volume within the same region, but different availability zones requires an extra Swift storage quota. If you don't have an ability to use Swift in this case, you can specify a `--clone-via-snapshot` flag.

~> **Note:** It is strongly recommended to shut down the VM before you start a migration of a VM or its volumes.

~> **Note:** By default cyclone writes all OpenStack request/response logs into a `cyclone` directory, located in System Temporary Directory. Define `-d` or `--debug` flag if you want to see these logs in console output.

## Examples

### Clone an image between regions

```sh
$ source openrc-of-the-source-project
$ cyclone image 77c125f1-2c7b-473e-a56b-28a9a0bc4787 --to-region eu-de-2 --to-project destination-project-name --to-image-name image-from-source-project-name
```

~> **Note:** Please ensure that your OpenStack user has sufficient permissions (e.g. `image_admin` and `swiftoperator` user roles) before initiating the above command.

### Clone an image between regions using download/upload method

Pay attention that the image data will be streamed through cyclone. It is recommended to use this method, when cyclone is executed directly on the VM, located in the source or destination region.

```sh
$ source openrc-of-the-source-project
$ cyclone image 77c125f1-2c7b-473e-a56b-28a9a0bc4787 --to-region eu-de-2 --to-project destination-project-name --to-image-name image-from-source-project-name --image-web-download=false
```

### Clone a bootable volume between regions

```sh
$ source openrc-of-the-source-project
$ cyclone volume c4c18329-b124-4a23-8546-cf1ca502ef95 --to-region eu-de-2 --to-project destination-project-name --to-volume-name volume-from-source-project-name
```

### Clone a volume within the same project, but different availability zones

```sh
$ source openrc-of-the-source-project
$ cyclone volume 97d682ae-840f-461f-b956-98af30533a22 --to-az eu-de-2a
```

### Clone a server with all attached volumes to a specific availability zone

```sh
$ source openrc-of-the-source-project
$ cyclone server 6eb76733-95b7-4867-9f83-a6ab19804e2f --to-az eu-de-2a --to-key-name my-nova-keypair
```

### Clone a server with a local storage to a server with bootable Cinder storage

`--bootable-volume 16` will create a 16 GiB bootable volume from the source VM snapshot and create a new VM using this volume.

```sh
$ source openrc-of-the-source-project
$ cyclone server 6eb76733-95b7-4867-9f83-a6ab19804e2f --bootable-volume 16 --to-key-name my-nova-keypair
```

### Clone a server with a local disk or a bootable volume only

`--bootable-disk-only` flag allows to clone a VM with only a local disk or a bootable volume, ignoring all secondary attached volumes.

```sh
$ source openrc-of-the-source-project
$ cyclone server 6eb76733-95b7-4867-9f83-a6ab19804e2f --bootable-disk-only --to-key-name my-nova-keypair
```

### Clone a server with a bootable volume to a server with a local disk

`--local-disk` allows to clone a VM with a Cinder bootable volume to a VM with a local disk.

```sh
$ source openrc-of-the-source-project
$ cyclone server 6eb76733-95b7-4867-9f83-a6ab19804e2f --local-disk --to-key-name my-nova-keypair
```

### Upload a local image file into a backup

Properties must be defined, when a backup supposed to be restored to a bootable volume.

```sh
$ source openrc-of-the-source-project
$ cyclone backup upload my-file.vmdk --to-container-name swift-backup-container --volume-size=160 --threads=16 \
  -p hw_vif_model=VirtualVmxnet3 \
  -p vmware_ostype=sles12_64Guest \
  -p hypervisor_type=vmware \
  -p min_ram=1008 \
  -p vmware_disktype=streamOptimized \
  -p disk_format=vmdk \
  -p hw_video_ram=16 \
  -p vmware_adaptertype=paraVirtual \
  -p container_format=bare \
  -p min_disk=10 \
  -p architecture=x86_64 \
  -p hw_disk_bus=scsi
```

### Upload a remote Glance image into a backup

```sh
$ source openrc-of-the-source-project
$ cyclone backup upload my-glance-image --to-container-name swift-backup-container --volume-size=160 --threads=16
```

### Transfer a big volume from one region to another

~> **Note:** The `cyclone backup upload` command produces high traffic and CPU/RAM usage. It's recommended to run it inside a VM, located in the target region.

In this case you need to convert a volume to an image first:

```sh
$ source openrc-of-the-source-project
$ cyclone volume to-image my-cinder-volume --to-image-name my-glance-image
```

then transfer it within multiple parallel connections to a target backup resource with a further volume restore action.

```sh
$ source openrc-of-the-source-project
$ cyclone backup upload my-glance-image --to-container-name swift-backup-container --to-region my-region-1 \
  --volume-size=160 --threads=16 --restore-volume
```

It's strongly recommended to run the `cyclone backup upload` command inside a VM, located in the source or the target region.

### Create a new volume from an existing backup

```sh
$ source openrc-of-the-source-project
$ cyclone backup restore my-backup
```

### Clone an existing backup to another region

~> **Note:** The `cyclone backup clone` command produces high traffic. It's recommended to run it inside a VM, located in the source or the target region.

```sh
$ source openrc-of-the-source-project
$ cyclone backup clone my-backup --to-region my-region-1 --threads=16
```
